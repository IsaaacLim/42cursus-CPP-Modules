# Topics Covered:

Getting started with CPP

1. ex00

   - warm up with basic cpp syntax
   - can take c appoach but I created classes for my `toupper function`

2. ex01

   - first proper class created
   - handled inputs with `std::cin` & `std::getline`
   - implemented `do while loops`
   - implemented str modification functions with `str.erase` & `str.append`

3. ex02

   - wihtout fully understanding the tests.cpp file given, create an Account class that is usable by tests.cpp
   - have my Account class produce the same output as logfile.log (except the time log), (destructor order is based on the user system)
   - `shell` comparison command

     > awk -F ' ' '{print $2}'

     > comm -3 <file_1> <file_2>
