# Topics Covered

### ex00

- Intro to
  - Conical form
  - Operation overload

### ex01

- Function overload
- Fixed point numbers
  - They are data types with a specific number of digits reserved for the interger part and fractional part
  - eg: fixed point format of `IIIII.FFFFF` can represent max of `99999.99999` & smallest of `00000.00001`
  - I guess the purpose is to save memory when we know how accurate we want our data to be
- **Obj: Convert `int` & `float` to fixed point value with 8 fractional bits**

### ex02

- Many function and operator overloads
- Arithmetic operations for **Fixed Point Numbers**

### ex03

- Modifying a `const` variable through a pointer and `const_cast` _(Day 06's technique)_ [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-modify-a-const-variable-in-c/)
- Using Fixed Point to calculate of a point is inside a triangle
